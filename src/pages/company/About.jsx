      <div className="space-y-4 text-sm text-stone-500 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          NexTalk was born from a simple frustration: every team chat tool forced us to choose between privacy and convenience, between speed and features. We believed teams shouldn't have to compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In early 2025, our founding team — engineers and designers from companies like Google, Stripe, and Signal — came together with a shared mission: build a messaging platform that's as secure as it is delightful to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, NexTalk is used by over 10,000 teams in 150+ countries. We're a remote-first company of 35 people spread across 12 time zones, and we use NexTalk every day to build NexTalk.
